# phones
a small list of interesting analog phones. 

## > u-console
the [uConsole](https://www.clockworkpi.com/uconsole) is a lightweight, fantastical little machine that can essentially function as an old-school QWERTY cellphone and a Gameboy in one. seems to be working, with a caveat that it'll take a long time to ship (supply-chain issues). 

## > rotary un-smartphone (RUSP)
the [RUSP](https://skysedge.com/telecom/RUSP/index.html) is a mobile *rotary* phone. currently still experimental due to cellular service providers being hesitant to support it.

# non-phones
everything else.

## > zerowriter
[zerowriter](https://github.com/bitwerkstatt/zerowriter) is an updated typewriter that uses an e-paper screen, all in a cute form factor. decentralized methods of creation; i could probably make this right now, lol.
