# phones
i, like many other disaffected people of my generation, hate smartphone addiction with a passion. this has led me to the two tenets of the anti-phone-addiction movement: digital minimalism and dumbphonism. this post catalogs some interesting trinkets of the latter. 

## u-console
the [uConsole](https://www.clockworkpi.com/uconsole) is a lightweight, fantastical little machine that can essentially function as an old-school QWERTY cellphone and a Gameboy in one.

seems to be working, with a caveat that it'll take a long time to ship (supply-chain issues). 

## rotary un-smartphone (RUSP)
the [RUSP](https://skysedge.com/telecom/RUSP/index.html) is a mobile *rotary* phone.

currently still experimental due to cellular service providers being hesitant to support it.

# non-phones
dumbphonism is a subset of the more general "one-purpose-one-tool" movement, which also has its own supporters (typically among writers and programmers, who love computers for their word-processing revolution but not for multitasking addiction).

## zerowriter
[zerowriter](https://github.com/bitwerkstatt/zerowriter) is an updated typewriter that uses an e-paper screen, all in a cute form factor.

decentralized methods of creation; i could probably make this right now, lol.
